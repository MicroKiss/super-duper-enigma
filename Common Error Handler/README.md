# Common error handler

A C++ error/warning and notification handler which is easy and straightforward to use for smaller projects.

I always found that the error handling is a sensitive topic for many people and not straightforward enough to deal with it normally. So I decided to create a simple solution that I can use in my future projects.

For usage see the `demo.cpp` file
